# DS Performance Overlay

A simple performance overlay to add to your game.

The performance overlay can be edited in appearance (background color, font size, text color).

To install, just drag the DSPerformanceOverlay plugin folder in res://addons/ into your own addons folder (or just drag the whole addons folder from this repo if you don't have any other addons folder yet).

Then, instantiate the DSOverlay scene wherever you see fit (your player scene, or your main scene). You can either drag the DSOverlay scene directly from the plugin folder, or instantiate a child scene through the scene tree (although you may need to enable Addons within that screen).

When it's instantiated, you have some options on the right sidebar. Text Color, Background Color, and Font Size are purely visual. The "Selected Overlay" is a dictionary. The default values can be used or removed, and you can add more. Just pick a performance type you want to add, then give it a label and click "Add Key/Value Pair".
